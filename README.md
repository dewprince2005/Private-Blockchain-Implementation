I've created a comprehensive private blockchain setup with both Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum networks, complete with a working DApp. Here's what has been delivered:
üèóÔ∏è Blockchain Infrastructure
Hyperledger Fabric Private Network

Docker Compose Setup: Multi-container network with 2 orgs, 2 peers, 1 orderer
Certificate Authorities: Automated CA setup for both organizations
Channel Configuration: Pre-configured channel with proper policies
Asset Management Chaincode: Complete JavaScript smart contract for asset registry
Deployment Scripts: Automated network setup and chaincode deployment

Ethereum Private Network

Genesis Block Configuration: Custom private network with pre-funded accounts
Multi-Node Setup: 2 Geth nodes with mining capabilities
Block Explorer: Web interface for network monitoring
Hardhat Integration: Development framework for smart contract deployment

üé® Sample DApp - Digital Asset Registry
Features

Multi-Network Support: Switch between Fabric and Ethereum networks
Asset Management: Create, view, and manage digital assets on blockchain
Wallet Integration: Connect to blockchain networks
Real-time Dashboard: Live stats and asset monitoring
Responsive Design: Modern React UI with Tailwind CSS

Functionality

Create digital assets (certificates, properties, licenses)
Track ownership and value on blockchain
View transaction history and asset status
Network-specific operations (Fabric chaincode vs Ethereum contracts)
